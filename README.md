### project gist:

our project encompasses around better recommendation of cinema. we plan to build a recommendation engine along with a usable front-end interface as well. we will have an API made in Flask and Python, that will be used by the client to access the recommendation engine. The recommendation engine itself will be trained on processed data collected from subreddits and/or imdb.
